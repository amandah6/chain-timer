# chain-timer
## How to use
1. Download `chain-timer.sh` or copy its contents into a text file and rename it "chain-timer.sh"

2. Store the file in your Desktop folder or a folder of your choice

3. Open up your terminal and type `cd desktop`, this will put you in your Desktop folder. 
 If you put your script in a different folder, navigate to the folder you stored your script in by typing `cd` followed by the folder name. 
 
- Note that `cd` will only bring you up one directory, so if you put the script in `/Users/YourUser/Desktop/mycoolscripts/`, you would have to type: 
 ```
 cd desktop
 cd mycoolscripts
 ```
 
4. Run the command `chmod +x chain-timer.sh`, this makes your script file executeable. You only need to do this once.

5. Finally, to start the script, run the command `bash chain-timer.sh`
